Gradle JBS
==========

This directory is for two purposes:

1. A test for the init files via the exec-maven-plugin
2. A hack to enable IDE support for gradle build files. The gradle build files are symlinked here so that they can be worked on with code completion, as their actual location is not gradle enabled.
